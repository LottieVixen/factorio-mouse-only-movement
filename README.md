Move with the mouse
------------------------------------

This mod lets you move your player character with the mouse, instead of using the WASD keys.

The way it works, is when you trigger the move custom command, the mod generates a capsule in your cursor. 
When the capsule is used, it can read the target position, and move the player character there.
If both functions are bound to the same key (left mouse button by default), a single click will suffice.
Otherwise, you will have to use the move button, then left click on the map where you want to go.
